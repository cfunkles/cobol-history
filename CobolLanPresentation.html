		<h2>Common Business Oriented Language</h2>
		<p>COBOL is a high-level programming language for business applications developed in 1959 by <abbr title="Conference/Committe on Data Systems Languages">CODASYL</abbr> (Conference/Committe on Data Systems Languages). COBOL is based off of Grace Hopper's Flow-Matic programming language. COBOL was concieved at the Pentagon.</p>

	<section> <!-- this section answers the purpose of COBOL -->
		<h2>What is the purpose of COBOL?</h2>
		<p>COBOL is a language many businesses use to work with large amounts of data, such as financial transactions. COBOL is a high level language that is written almost like English. An example of COBOL would be <code>Add $ to Account</code>, whereas in Javascript you would write <code>balance += paycheck;</code>. The CODASYL committee that conjured COBOL wanted the language to be easy to use and accessable to many programers. COBOL is really good at handeling batch data.</p>
		<p>COBAL is divided into four divisions</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Identification Division</li>
			<li>Environment Division</li>
			<li>Data Division</li>
			<li>Procedure Division</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>What kind of language is COBOL</h2>
		<h4>Here is an example</h4>

		<p>From what I could find on Wikipedia's "COBOL" is a complier Language, and because of that I guess it is a stronly typed language. COBOL is an imperitive language also known as a procedural language. These languages tend to be written as though it's normal English.</p>

	<section> <!-- this section has some history of COBOL and it's versions -->
		<h2>A timeline history of COBOL</h2>
		<ul class="leftText">
			<li><strong>1955-1959</strong> Grace Hopper developed the Flow-Matic compiler language to express business data operations more like English statements.</li>
			<li><strong>May 1959</strong> COBOL was born in a meeting with 41 people include Grace Hopper at the Pentagon. After agreeing that more people should be able to program utilizing COBOL's English like syntax.</li>
			<li><strong>June 1959</strong> The committee responsible for the development of COBOL was named CODASYL.<br><em>The commitee consisted of 3 goverment agencies-</em> 
				<ol>
					<li>National Bureau of Standards</li>
					<li>Department of Defence</li>
					<li>Navy's David Taylor Model Basin</li>
				</ol> <em> and 6 computer manufacturers-</em>
				<ol>
					<li>Burroughs Corporation</li>
					<li>IBM</li>
					<li>Minneapolis-Honeywell</li>
					<li>RCA</li>
					<li>Sperry Rand</li>
					<li>Sylvania Electric Products</li>
				</ol>
			</li>
			<li><strong>January 1960</strong> COBOL-60 was approved and new manufacturing companies started using COBOL on their systems.</li>
			<li><strong>1961</strong> COBOL-61 was released. The first versions of COBOL could only do 3 to 11 statements per minute. Newer versions of COBOL were released with improved compilers, and therefore computers needed more memory to perform at faster speeds.</li>
			<li><strong>1965</strong> COBOL-65 was released bringing more clarifications and with ability to control mass storage files and tables better.</li>
			<li><strong>1968</strong> COBOL-68 released to overcome incompatibility issues.</li>
			<li><strong>1974</strong> COBOL-74 was released and becomes the most widely used programming language on the planet. The COBOL-74 version had new features like delete, examine, and ispect.</li>
			<li><strong>1985</strong> COBOL-85 was released with new features, deleted features, and revised features.</li>
			<li><STRONG>1997</STRONG> COBOL now has 200 billion lies of code used in 80% of businesses. Developers start to worry about Y2K! Work starts on fixing date issues. Many programmers come out of retirement to solve these issues.</li>
			<li><strong>2000</strong> The World did not blow up! YAY!</li>
